        "*   No missing values were found in the dataset during the initial data cleaning step.\n",
        "*   Outliers in numerical features were handled by capping using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.\n",
        "*   Logarithmic transformation was applied to skewed features ('total\\_rooms', 'total\\_bedrooms', 'population', 'households', 'median\\_income'), improving their distribution towards a normal distribution.\n",
        "*   Exploratory data analysis revealed the distributions of features, relationships between variables (including correlations with `median_house_value`), and the geographical distribution of `median_house_value`.\n",
        "*   Five new features were successfully engineered: `rooms_per_household`, `bedrooms_per_room`, `population_per_household`, `bedroom_ratio`, and `households_per_population`.\n",
        "*   `median_house_value` was defined as the target variable (`y`), and all other columns were designated as features (`X`).\n",
        "*   The data was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.\n",
        "*   Two regression models, Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor, were trained on the training data.\n",
        "*   Model evaluation showed that the Random Forest Regressor performed significantly better than the Linear Regression model, with a lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) of approximately 2.59 billion compared to 4.71 billion for Linear Regression, and a higher R-squared score of 0.80 compared to 0.65.\n",
        "*   Feature importance analysis of the Random Forest model indicated that 'median\\_income', 'longitude', and 'latitude' were the most influential factors in predicting the target variable (proxy for climate risk).\n",
        "*   Predicted climate risk scores were generated for the test dataset using the trained Random Forest model and added as a new column.\n",
        "*   Visualizations were created to display the top feature importances, compare actual vs. predicted risk scores, and show the geographical distribution of the predicted climate risk scores.\n",

        "\n",
        "*   The strong influence of geographical location (longitude and latitude) suggests the importance of incorporating spatial data or region-specific factors into the model for a more nuanced climate risk assessment.\n",
        "*   Given that 'median\\_income' is a major predictor, future steps could involve exploring the relationship between socio-economic factors and climate risk more deeply, or investigating if higher income areas are genuinely less vulnerable or simply have higher property values for unrelated reasons.\n"

        "* No missing values were found in the dataset during the initial data cleaning step.\n",
        "* Outliers in numerical features were handled by capping using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.\n",
        "* Logarithmic transformation was applied to skewed features ('total_rooms', 'total_bedrooms', 'population', 'households', 'median_income'), improving their distribution towards a normal distribution.\n",
        "* Exploratory data analysis revealed the distributions of features, relationships between variables (including correlations with `median_house_value`), and the geographical distribution of `median_house_value`.\n",
        "* Five new features were successfully engineered: `rooms_per_household`, `bedrooms_per_room`, `population_per_household`, `bedroom_ratio`, and `households_per_population`.\n",
        "* `median_house_value` was defined as the target variable (`y`), and all other columns were designated as features (`X`).\n",
        "* The data was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.\n",
        "* Two regression models, Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor, were trained on the training data.\n",
        "* Model evaluation showed that the Random Forest Regressor performed significantly better than the Linear Regression model, with a lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) of approximately 2.59 billion compared to 4.71 billion for Linear Regression, and a higher R-squared score of 0.80 compared to 0.65.\n",
        "* Feature importance analysis of the Random Forest model indicated that 'median_income', 'longitude', and 'latitude' were the most influential factors in predicting the target variable (proxy for climate risk).\n",
        "* Predicted climate risk scores were generated for the test dataset using the trained Random Forest model and added as a new column.\n",
        "* Visualizations were created to display the top feature importances, compare actual vs. predicted risk scores, and show the geographical distribution of the predicted climate risk scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "* The strong influence of geographical location (longitude and latitude) suggests the importance of incorporating spatial data or region-specific factors into the model for a more nuanced climate risk assessment.\n",
        "* Given that 'median_income' is a major predictor, future steps could involve exploring the relationship between socio-economic factors and climate risk more deeply, or investigating if higher income areas are genuinely less vulnerable or simply have higher property values for unrelated reasons."
